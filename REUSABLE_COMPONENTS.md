# Reusable components

Every agnostic component (UI control, extension, helper, etc) should be created in a separate repository and in Swift.

Your component should be unit tested and documented.

# Steps to create a component

- [ ] Use this template: https://github.com/JohnSundell/SwiftPlate
- [ ] Create a local folder with your project name and run `swiftplate` from there
- [ ] üë∂  Author: Your own name
- [ ] üì´  Author email: hello@bakkenbaeck.no
- [ ] üåç  GitHub URL: https://github.com/bakkenbaeck/<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
- [ ] üè¢  Organization Name: Bakken & Baeck

# Steps to ship your component

Before shipping your component make sure that the README states what makes your Pod different than the other ones, been made by you might not be enough. It's very important that your README is :star2: fabulous :star2:.

Make sure to provide a super simple example on how to get your Pod up and running, if it is dependent on other Pods you should explain why you need them and what they do. Don't assume that people know everything.

If it's a visual component include a `.gif` showing how does it work or what does it do. It helps a lot for people to understand your Pod without having to clone, build and run your project. A good tool to make gifs is [Licecap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/).

- [ ] Make sure to have a cool logo
- [ ] Submit it to [Cocoa Controls](https://www.cocoacontrols.com/)
- [ ] Make a PR to [iOS Goodies](https://github.com/iOS-Goodies/iOS-Goodies)
- [ ] Submit your component to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), your post should start with **Show HN**

**Send a few tweets from the @bakkenbaeck account**

Always express yourself like you are part of a team, use **"We did this"** and never **"I did this"**.
Take the time to compose personal tweets to all your recipients, copy pasting one message to everyone makes you sound like a robot and feels spammy, don't do this.
